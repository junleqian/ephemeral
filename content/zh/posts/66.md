I went to John's house on Thanksgiving. I just wanted to experience a true thanksgiving from the reality but not the English textbook.

Of course it is a really big western festival for people here to celebrate. However it is not like a task which you have to finish in a limited period. The western family always choose to have a feast on the first day of the Thanksgiving 4-day holiday, but if there is some emergency or accident, you may also change the date for the fantastic feast. It all depends on the host 's willing.

How do I kill the 4-day-long holiday? well, that is a good question which I also want to ask myself. I am convinced that I haven't prepared for the SAT test and the final exams. So I should read some books for them, as soon as possible. I know Americans are bored by holidays.They just wander in the room to be worried about something you don't need to be or sit in the sofa like a sofa potato. That is what they are always doing during holidays.

After Thanksgiving I have another week to review everything I have learned this semester. I am being nervous or anxious. I feel a little excited because I have chance to visit my cousin and his family on Dec 12th and I can see his new cute baby.

Almost done, I give myself 100 even if I can not get such a good one on paper. I have got it in my mind.
