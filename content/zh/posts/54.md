What the fuck?

The address is 1983 E 24th St, but the express company sent the package to Viking Hall without checking the Street number actually! I want to make complaints! Because of their nice help, I have to take it in another building and most importantly if it reached that place 3 days ago and I didn't take it, it will be sent back! And that awesome stuff will take me 1 more week again. 1 more week?! What the fuck? I already have little time to review SAT and ACT, now you tell me it will be delayed 1 more week because of express mistake? Ridiculous, gentlemen, ridiculous!

Today I had the stupid class. We watched a video called fired shooter, which was talking about how to deal with a shooting crime on campus. Well, that's fun, a bunch of actors performed seriously to simulate the emergency situation. Now I know why the social security in America is better than that in China. It is because the difference between actors and actresses' performance in such an emergency-dealing video.

I have a lot of stuff to do, asking something about checking in or checking out from the dorm, making it clear what the specific dates when the semester ends up and next semester will begin, and completing my program 9.

Without the fucking express mistake, I feel good.
