However this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of voilation!

The only verdict is vengeance a vendetta held as a votive not in vain for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous...

Verily this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose. So let me simply add that it's very good honor to meet you and you may call me V.
