I am sorry. I have to stop my diary for a period. I want to get in cramming for top university. I know who I am and how could I destine myself. I am sorry to everyone who wants to know me, understand me and look for me, I am sorry I have things more important to do.

<!--more-->

I am involved in it. I am addicted in it. I am so sorry I can not put off so many requirements from myself. I will never forget why I am here so just let me go back to the range I have no other ideas.

There is only one thing I care. It worth me endeavoring. I don't need to say sorry any more in the future, I hope, dramatically.
