I am so glad I am busy again. I have 3 classes today, have to do the laundry, read 3 textbooks detailedly, have to do exercises for them, have to prepare the lab outline for the new experiment tomorrow, have to prepare ACT exam and have to make Java notes by reviewing the book.

<!--more-->

Java programming class has turned to a theoretical chapter so I have a bunch of stuff to read. Calculus turned to a new chapter which I have never learned before.Therefore, I am so excited! That's why I am here, baby, that's why I am here!

I feel that I am becoming a person can not tolerate free and boring life. Fair enough, busy again, excited again!
