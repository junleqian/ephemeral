Today I have done a bunch of important things by myself. I feel satisfied by myself.

<!--more-->

Today I got the exact dates for check-in next semester and made the schedule for all final exams. I am convinced that I did good job in my position. And I returned all the books I had borrowed from the library for avoiding trouble.

Tomorrow I will go to the AT&T company to check the cellphone bill definitely. It increased 30 dollars more than last month, which is abnormal. I think I have to make it clear. Tomorrow is the Veterans' Day and of course a holiday so I have a lot of time to read and handle all my stuff.
I modified the program 9 because I found an error (the average is 120.33 not exactly 120.00, I didn't save it as a "double" type so the computer just give me an integral number). And tomorrow I will do the laundry!

OK,OK, I have assignments to do this night. Have a good day to everyone who is concerned about my business. Thank you but after all, it is my business.Just leave the worry to me. I am the not the genius. But I will be, and will be him soon. Be myself back.
