This morning I got up very late at almost 10.30. I never did this before. I think there is a kind of magic causing you to change your time table without awareness. This afternoon I was dizzy and chatting with Bibby's past girlfriend. She said Bibby now was really popular in the college. A girl even wanted to have something with him... Well, I know he is a really good man and he still fell in love with his past girlfriend. He loved her so much that he couldn't make himself believe that was just a game. He paid the true heart to her. And he still has the chance to get her back probably.

I must read! These two thanksgiving days I almost did nothing about studying and reviewing. It sucks. Couldn't I control my self in an appropriate range. I know I can! I must finish at least 60 pages per day during this holiday, at least!

Trust me I can handle all this. I can.
