Yes, yes, the books of SAT have all been here, and there are not any more excuses to let me avoid practicing or stopping playing. I am not convinced I need a lot of cramming but I really need to remind myself that the days turn to be different, now it is the time to turn the destiny over.This is your blood, your land, your right, no one can stop you but yourself.That is what I am saying, fight and no joke.

I will make a schedule about doing exercises in SAT books. I also have to ask the check-in time next semester because of its importance. Yesterday's night I watched the most popular American movie series-Ocean's Eleven, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen. This is the first time forget theft is a kind of crimes! The actors and actresses performed excellently.I like these criminal movies such as Sin City or Killer 47. They release something inside myself.

Ok, I have to complete lab report and make a plan about program 10 in Java Programming class. It is also very critical to read the textbooks detailedly especially the new chapter talking about atom structures in Chemistry and the applications for Calculus. Well, I will be a little busier, and busier and busier.

Fair enough.
