These days I feel weird. Sometimes I feel tired and want to sleep.But I am always waken up by some excitement when I have already lied on the bed. Maybe I need something like a doll or a warm bath to give me a little comfort to fall asleep.

Yesterday night I played squash. Hey, sports , long time no see! Ah, probably it is a kind of punishment that I felt ache after I played it. Suddenly I become tired and easy to be involved in my small bed.

Houston Rockets , for which Yao Ming plays, is a really confusing team that always wobbles between winning and losing. 75 to 77, they lost the game versus San Antonio last week and there were so many opportunities to make it but the truth was they failed. I have no idea. I just hope they will be better, at least better than what they have become.

OK, I am stepping in the warm bath, don't bother me , NBA!
